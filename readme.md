# Fetch files from CyberArk SFE

Non-Windows users who needs to get files from CyberArk Vault (SIM) cannot do this using the One-Click-Transfer application, because only Windows is supported. This script will help you alternatively fetch the files using the SFE web interface.



## How to use it?

Replace the values of {cyberark-sfe-address}, {safe-name}, {username}, {password} with a relevant ones (you may want to change the download_directory's value too) and run it.
